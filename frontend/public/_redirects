# Netlify _redirects file
# Alternative to netlify.toml for SPA routing
# Place this file in the public/ folder so Vite copies it to dist/ during build

# SPA routing fallback - redirect all requests to index.html
# Status 200 means this is a rewrite (not a redirect), preserving the URL
/*    /index.html   200
